    "source": "Zapdos serves as a great wallbreaker, boasting natural bulk that allows it to take hits from physical attackers like Rillaboom and Urshifu-R and threaten them with paralysis through Static. If rain is active, Weather Ball lets Zapdos nuke defensive Ground-types such as Iron Treads, Gliscor, and Landorus-T, while Supersonic Skystrike can be used to finish off weakened defensive Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Galarian Slowking or in important turns when the risk of missing a Hurricane would prove way too costly.\nZapdos can be a great addition to offense teams where its ability to inflict foes with paralysis is greatly appreciated. Zapdos has the ability to loosely check Fighting-types like Zamazenta, Great Tusk, and Mega Medicham, which can go a long way for teammates like Kingambit and Ferrothorn. The aforementioned Fighting-types can also be great teammates to Zapdos, as they help in dealing with Pokemon like Ting-Lu and Mega Tyranitar. Additionally, Great Tusk can remove Stealth Rock Rocks. When used on rain, staples like Barraskewda and Mega Swampert appreciate Zapdos's help in dealing with bulky Water-types such as Alomomola and Slowbro as well as Grass-types like Ogerpon-W and Ferrothorn. Galarian Slowking and Raging Bolt are both frustrating for Zapdos to break, so teammates such as Pursuit Kingambit or bulky Ground-types like Iron Treads and Ting-Lu are good to deal with them.",
