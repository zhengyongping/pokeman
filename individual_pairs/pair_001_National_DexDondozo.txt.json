    "source": "With massive physical bulk, the superb ability of Unaware, and a solid defensive typing, Dondozo functions as a sturdy wall to many of the physical threats roaming the tier. While it prefers Liquidation, Waterfall is a good alternative, trading power and a potential Defense drop for greater PP, allowing Dondozo to continually chip away at threats during longer games. Curse turns Dondozo into an intimidating win condition in the later stages of the game, able to set up on the likes of Mega Mawile and Gouging Fire, while Body Press allows Dondozo to hit Water-resistant foes like Ferrothorn and Ogerpon-W. Tera Dragon flips the matchup on Pokemon which would normally threaten it, such as Kartana, Rillaboom, and especially Ogerpon-W. Due to its passive nature, Dondozo is found mainly on bulky teams, partnering well with Pokemon like Gliscor and Ting-Lu, which can handle Dondozo checks like Toxapex, Mega Latios, and Mega Latias, while Dondozo can check the Water-types that would threaten them, like Urshifu-R or Hisuian Samurott. Dondozo usually carries Heavy-Duty Boots as its item to ensure it can switch in safely when it is used on teams with less reliable entry hazard removal, though if paired with a reliable hazard remover like Tornadus-T, Dondozo can opt for Leftovers to shore up its poor recovery, allowing it to 1v1 threats such as Mega Scizor and Zamazenta more reliably.",
    "target": "在优秀的耐久，纯朴特性和不错的防御属性加持下，吃吼霸能够很好地挡住环境中许多物理威胁。虽然它多数时候使用水流裂破，但是攀瀑也是可考虑的选项，用威力和降低对手防御的特效换来了更多的PP，使吃吼霸能够在长对局中持续地消耗对手。诅咒使吃吼霸在残局成为极具威胁的获胜点，能够对着超级大嘴娃和破空焰等对手强化，而扑击能够打击坚果哑铃和厄诡椪-水井面具等抵抗或免疫水属性招式的宝可梦。太晶龙扭转了吃吼霸对纸御剑、轰擂金刚猩和厄诡椪-水井面具等常规情况下能威胁它的宝可梦的相性。因为其较为被动，吃吼霸常见于耐久向队伍，天蝎王和古鼎鹿等能帮助解决超坏星、超级拉帝欧斯和超级拉帝亚斯等吃吼霸check，因此它们与吃吼霸配合良好，吃吼霸也能帮助它们解决武道熊师-连击流和洗翠大剑鬼等威胁到它们的水属性宝可梦。在缺少清钉手段的队伍里，吃吼霸通常携带厚底靴来保证它可以安全地换入，如果与龙卷云-灵兽等可靠的清钉手搭档，吃吼霸可以选择携带吃剩的东西来提升它贫弱的回复能力，使它更轻松地赢下与超级巨钳螳螂和藏玛然特等威胁的1V1对决。",
