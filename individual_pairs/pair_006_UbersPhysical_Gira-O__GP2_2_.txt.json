    "source": "Giratina-O is most notable for being the only offensive Defog user in Ubers, giving it a distinct niche. Its high bulk and unique typing combined with Levitate give it great use against top metagame threats like Arceus-Ground, Extreme Killer Arceus, and Kyogre. While its offensive stats are a bit low by Ubers standards, it makes up for it with Griseous Core's boost and access to high-Base Power moves like Poltergeist, Draco Meteor, and Hex. Furthermore, Will-O-Wisp, Thunder Wave, and Shadow Sneak are all great utility options at Giratina-O's disposal. Giratina-O is also one of the best users of Terastallization in the tier, becoming extremely tanky with Tera Steel or Poison in combination with Levitate. However, Giratina-O has no reliable recovery and thus can be chipped down by Stealth Rock and Ruination damage over time. It also stacks weaknesses with Koraidon and Miraidon, two of the most common Pokemon in the tier.",
    "target": "骑拉帝纳-起源最引人注目的一点是它是Ubers中唯一进攻型清除浓雾使用者，这赋予了它明确的定位。它的高耐久和独特的属性组合与飘浮特性相结合，使其非常适合对抗环境中的顶级威胁，如阿尔宙斯-地面、神速杀手阿尔宙斯和盖欧卡。虽然它的进攻种族值相对Ubers的标准较低，但大白金宝玉的提升与灵骚、流星群和祸不单行等高威力招式弥补了这一点。此外，磷火、电磁波和影子偷袭都是骑拉帝纳-起源可以使用的绝佳功能型招式。骑拉帝纳-起源也是该分级中太晶化的最佳使用者之一，太晶钢或毒与飘浮结合使用会使其耐久变得非常厚实。然而，骑拉帝纳-起源没有稳定的回复，因此随着对局的推移，它会被隐形岩和大灾难削弱。同时它也被该分级中最强势的两只宝可梦，故勒顿和密勒顿极度克制。",
